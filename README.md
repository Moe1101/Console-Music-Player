# Console-Music-Player


I Only uploaded the source code files because the project files where kinda big
(and im sorry if that isnt what i should do I'm new to github )
however if you wanna use this code make sure to create a project and then 
2 cpp files and 2 headers the same way i created them and use the same names then copy the code into them 


Anws about this prject , its just a really simple c++ music player thats shows a menu in the console with 
option to add a song to either head or tail of the list 
option to delete a song by enterig its name
otpion to display all songs or favorite songs 
option to modify any attribute about the song
and ofcourse option to play a song then play the one prevoius to it or the one after it
